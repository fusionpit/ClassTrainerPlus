# Class Trainer Plus
Class Trainer Plus is an addon for World of Warcraft Classic that upgrades the Class Trainer interface, adding the ability to ignore, search, and train all.

## Ignoring
You can ignore any spell offered by your class or pet trainer by right-clicking and checking the "Ignore" option.  You can then hide them from view like the other available filters.

## Searching
Easily find spells to ignore by using the search box.

## Training All Available Spells
When the Shift key is held, the Train button will allow all available, non-ignored spells to be trained at one time.
